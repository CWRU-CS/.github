# CWRU Computer Science Clubs Organization

Welcome to an attempt at organizing a single meeting place for computer science related [CWRU](https://case.edu/) clubs!

## Permissions

If you're an important person in a CS club and you haven't received an invite for write privileges in this GitHub organization, send an email to [bwp18@case.edu](mailto:bwp18@case.edu).

To prevent absolute chaos, try to appoint one person from each club.

## Website

This GitHub organization will have at least one repo: a simple website for links to and descriptions of every CS/CE related club at Case. If your club's not on it yet, make a branch and add yourself.

If you have other repo ideas (other clubs' websites, class information, etc.), tell people about them or start them yourself.
